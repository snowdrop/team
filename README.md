# Snowdrop Team

This is the Snowdrop Team repository that we are using to encode our daily tasks and will manage using the Zenhub workspace `Weekly report`.

So, when you start a new week of work, please :
- Create an `Epic` to group your issues/tasks using as convention : `Week dd` where `dd` is the week number,
- Create issues,
- Assign them to yourself
- Labelize the issue using the following labels : https://github.com/snowdrop/snowdrop-team/labels?q=-

**Remark**: Move on your issue during the week using the kanban board and columns : `New Issue`, `Icebox`, `Backlog`, `In Progress` and `Done`
