# Snowdrop Team

This is the Snowdrop Team repository that we are using to encode our daily tasks and will use as Kanban Board.

So, when you start a new week of work, please create a new Issue having as Title `Week dd : Tasks` where `dd` is the week number. Add a list of tasks under the description. 

Example : 
```
Title: Week 19 : Tasks
Assignee: Charles Moulliard
Description : 
- [x] Team 1-1 meetings
- [ ]  Lead meeting to introduce PNC changes and Snowdrop releasing issue
- [x] Review Managers cal and what they offer/propose
- [x] Review and enhance the list of the categories to be used to encode tasks/action items
- [ ] Schedule meeting with Stakeholders for Ansible MW initiative
```

**Remark**: Extend the list of the tasks during the week and move the issue under the column `In Progress`. End of the week (= Thursday, when the reporting tool will populate the report), then move the issue to `Done` column.

Assign the tasks to yourself !

Labelize the tasks using the following categories : https://github.com/snowdrop/snowdrop-team/labels?q=-
