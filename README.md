# Snowdrop Team

This is the Snowdrop Team repository that we are using to encode our daily tasks and will use as Kanban Board.

So, when you start a new week of work, please :
- Create a new issue having as Title `Week dd : Tasks` where `dd` is the week number,
- Add a list of tasks under the description. 
- Assign the issue to yourself
- Labelize the issue using the label `3 - Team work`

Example : 
```
Title: Week 19 : Tasks
Assignee: Charles Moulliard
Description : 
- [x] Team 1-1 meetings
- [ ] Lead meeting to introduce PNC changes and Snowdrop releasing issue
- [x] Review Managers cal and what they offer/propose
- [x] Review and enhance the list of the categories to be used to encode tasks/action items
- [ ] Schedule meeting with Stakeholders for Ansible MW initiative
```

**Important**: Extend the list of the tasks during the week and move the issue under the column `In Progress`. End of the week (= Thursday, when the reporting tool will populate the report), then move the issue to `Done` column.

**Remark**: When you work on different tasks according to the following list or labels : following categories : https://github.com/snowdrop/snowdrop-team/labels?q=-, then create a issue fior the corresponding label and manage it using the collumns: `New Issue`, `Icebox`, `Backlog`, `In Progress` and `Done`
